        <h1>Data Analysis and Evaluation</h1>
        <p>Based on the extracted informations from our 3 data source, we have created 8 visualizations.</p>
        <embed src="./cost-of-living-choropleth.html"
          type="text/html" height="700" width="1000" />
        <p>Based on the first choropleth, the high cost areas are concentrated on the West Coast,the Northeast and Florida counties. On the other side, the midwest and the deep south show the lowest cost of living. These regions shows the highest purchasing power for residents that might contribute to happiness by lowering finanacial stress. We can also observe how cost changes as the region moves away from urban centers as we can see where high cost of living extends into suburban conunties but drops in rural areas.</p>

        <embed src="./Weighted QoL Percentile vs Cost of Living.html"

        <embed src="./Unweighted QoL Percentile vs Cost of Living.html"
          type="text/html" height="700" width="1000" />
        <p>The two visualizations showed above provides the insight of the difference between weighted and unweighted cost of living. We have our target audience of post graduate students and based on our thoughts on their priority, we weighted their priorities as 35% affordability, 50% economics and 15% safety. Coming to this equation: Quality of Life Score = 0.5*Norm Econ+0.35* Norm Aff+ 0.15*Norm Safe  for weighted quality of life. The two visualizations doesn't show much difference as both have no strong positive correlation and massive variation at low cost of living. This indicates that for a finanacial investment, there is a high reward trade-off. Moreover, as the cost of living goes beyond $100K, the density of points drops dramatically, indicating that extreemely high cost areas appear to offer a low quality of life. Therefore, the finanacial burden may be a major factor quality of life, or that high cost areas lack the social factors that constitures quality of life. </p>

        <p>The two visualizations showed above provides the weighted and unweighted quality of life percentile on each US county. Compared to the cost of living percentile map, where the West Coast had the highest cost of living, these visualizations show how the counties with highest cost of living has relatively low quality of life. Meanwhile, counties on the midwest with low cost of living shows high quality of life. Like the scatter plot, these two visualizations did not show difference between unweighted and weighted data. The map visualizations confirm that high cost of living does not translate to high quality of life and that low cost of living areas can offer surperior value. The return on investment for well-being is high on locations that has low financial pressure. Therefore, our data demonstrates that high cost of living acts as a strong disadvantage to quality of life.</p>

        <p>Now going on large-scale analysis, the visualization above shows the correlation of economic stability percentile with quality of life percentile on US counties and countries. This plot shows a clear positive correlation between the two factors, forming a parabolic band. This confirms that when economic health acts as a powerful precondition for high quality of life. The US counties (Blue) fills the entire graph while reaching the highest quality of life. On the other hand the orange dots representing countries seem to fall below the US counties, particularly in the mid-range of economic stability. Through this data, we can come to the conclusion that the top US countries set a higher standard than most countries. At the lowest economic stability percentile, there is a group of US counties that has quality of life in the 60~80 range, while most countries in this same range have quality of life below 40. This comes to the conclusion that even the counties in the US with significantly low economic stability maintains a minimum quality of life standard that is higher than many lower ranking countries. </p>
