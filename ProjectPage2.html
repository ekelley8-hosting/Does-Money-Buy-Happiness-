        <h1>Data Analysis and Evaluation</h1>
        <p>Based on the extracted informations from our 3 data source, we have created 8 visualizations.</p>
        <embed src="./cost-of-living-choropleth.html"
          type="text/html" height="700" width="1000" />
        <p>Based on the first choropleth, the highest CoL counties are concentrated on the West Coast, the Northeast, and in Florida. On the other hand, the midwest and the deep south show the lowest CoL. These “cheaper” regions show lower living expenses for residents, which might contribute to happiness by lowering financial burden. We can also observe how cost changes as the region moves away from urban centers as we can see where high CoL extends into suburban counties but drops in rural areas.</p>
        <embed src="./Metro vs Non-Metro Weighted QoL.html"
          type="text/html" height="700" width="1000" />
        <p>This box chart shows the comparison of metro and non-metro counties’ QoL distribution. Both groups have a similar median, suggesting that the average expected QoL is essentially equal for metro and non-metro areas. However, non-metro counties show a slightly wider range and the most overall high QoL scores (the upper outliers), suggesting that non-metro status offers the highest possible reward, but also carries the highest risk of low quality of life. </p>

        <embed src="./Unweighted QoL Percentile vs Cost of Living.html"

        <p>The two visualizations shown above can be used to compare our self-determined QoL metrics, between the weighted and unweighted versions. With our target audience of recent college graduates, we estimated what their priorities post-grade might be, and we weighted their QoL priorities to reach a single QoL value as follows: 50% economic health (using unemployment), 35% affordability (using median income and total CoL), and 15% safety (crime rates). For the unweighted QoL value, we equally distributes the three factors in thirds. The two visualizations are very similar, showing little difference in our determined weighted vs. unweighted priorities, potentially indicating that our QoL metric calculation has shortcomings. For example, one factor (such as economic health) may dominate the calculation of the QoL value, leading to little variation by county and CoL. Ultimately, both graphs show almost no correlation between CoL and QoL, and for any given CoL there is large variation in our determined QoL values. This indicates that there may not necessarily be a correlation between low CoL and a given QoL. However, while the majority of high QoL values lie at low CoL values, so do most low QoL values, indicating a dangerous risk-to-reward gamble for QoL.</p>

        <p>The two visualizations shown above provide the weighted and unweighted quality of life percentile on each US county. Compared to the cost of living percentile map, where the West Coast had the highest cost of living, these visualizations show how the counties with highest cost of living has relatively low quality of life. Meanwhile, counties on the midwest with low cost of living shows high quality of life. Like the scatter plot, these two visualizations did not show difference between unweighted and weighted data. The map visualizations confirm that high cost of living does not translate to high quality of life and that low cost of living areas can offer surperior value. The return on investment for well-being is high on locations that has low financial pressure. Therefore, our data demonstrates that high cost of living acts as a strong disadvantage to quality of life.</p>

        <p>In a domestic county vs. international countries analysis, the visualization above shows the correlation of economic stability percentile (ESP) with QoL percentile. This plot shows that as ESP increases, the correlation grows, and there is almost no correlation on the left side of the graph (large diversity). Additionally, the US counties, while significantly larger in number, still are more spread out over the graph, and the countries seem to spread less for a given ESP and have tighter correlation between the two factors examined. Through this data, we can come to the conclusion that as ESP increases, US counties see less diversity in QoL and it generally increases (the vertical spread shrinks as ESP increases, and QoL trends upwards), and internationally, there’s less variation across the board for QoL for a given ESP, and they seem to be directly related. This goes to say that low ESP more directly correlates to QoL internationally than it does in US counties, since US counties have larger QoL variation on the left side of the graph, and the two are slightly positively correlated. </p>
