        <h4>Motivation of this project:<br><br> 
            Our project is motivated by the desire to quantify the true "cost of happiness", which we will determine through cost of living and quality of life. We aim to identify what factors contribute to high and low quality of life, and where certain trade-offs may lie. By examining cost of living, quality of life, and factors such as unemployment and crime rate data, we aim to correlate the nonlinear connections that impact well-being. Our project's target audience is recent college (Notre Dame) graduates to guide them to where they might be happiest and have the highest quality of life.

        <h1>Data Source 1</h1> 
        <p>Description:<br>
            Data Source 1 includes the backbone of our analysis for counties in the US. It's a publicly available CSV file that includes information about crime and unemployment rates, median cost of living, median income, etc. for each county (organized by FIPS, or Federal Information Processing Standards, codes). This source enables us to examine various social and economic factors and quantify our "Quality of Life" score, and examine them on a national scale.</p>
        <div class='py-3 my-4'></div>
        <h1>Data Source 2</h1>
        <p>Description:<br>
            Data Source 2 shows insight into multiple factors of quality of life on an global scale by country, such as stability, rights, and climate, which allow us to evaluate the effect of nonfinancial factors on the trend of quality of life. With this CSV file we were able to determine whether high costs in the US are correlated with stability and quality of life, and differences arise when compared to a global scale. </p>
